# Supabase Setup Instructions

## Issue Fixed
The blank white page issue was caused by missing Supabase environment variables. The application was trying to initialize Supabase without proper configuration.

## What Was Fixed
1. **Created `.env` file** with placeholder Supabase configuration
2. **Updated Supabase client** to handle missing environment variables gracefully
3. **Modified authentication logic** to work in demo mode when Supabase is not configured
4. **Updated Dashboard component** to show mock data when Supabase is not available

## To Set Up Supabase (Optional)
If you want to use real Supabase functionality:

1. **Create a Supabase project** at https://supabase.com
2. **Get your project URL and anon key** from the Supabase dashboard
3. **Update the `.env` file** with your actual values:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-actual-anon-key
   ```

## Current Status
The application now works in "demo mode" with placeholder data when Supabase is not configured. You can access the dashboard at `localhost:8080/dashboard` and it will show:
- Mock user statistics
- Demo mode indicator
- Functional UI components

## Next Steps
- The application should now load properly without the blank white page
- You can test the UI and functionality
- Configure Supabase when ready for real data
